# Manila Mixins
A bunch of cool Sass Mixins in part made by me and others curated by me from various sources.

To override some settings just change the settings file or make a copy and import BEFORE Manila 😘

The provided examples are using `.sass` or the indented version of sass but you can use `.scss` as well I just don't like using it 🐶
